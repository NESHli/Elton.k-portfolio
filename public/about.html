<h1>About Me</h1>
<P>Hey there!   I'm Elton, a 22-year-old with a passion for both finance and technology.</P>
<P>For the past five years, I've been delving into the world of forex trading, honing my skills and navigating the ever-changing markets. It's been a journey of constant learning and adaptation, and I'm always looking for new strategies and insights to improve my game.</P>
<p>Recently, a new fascination sparked within me - the world of coding. I'm diving headfirst into learning both front-end and back-end development, eager to unlock the creative potential of building things from the ground up.  Whether it's crafting user-friendly interfaces or the complex logic behind them, I'm excited to see where this new path takes me.</p> 
<p>This website is a reflection of my evolving skillset and a platform to share my experiences and learnings in both forex trading and coding.  Feel free to stick around as I document this exciting journey of exploration and creation!
